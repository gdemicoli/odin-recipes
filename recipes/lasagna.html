                <li> garlic cloves , minced</li>
                <li>1 kg / 2 lb beef mince (ground beef) </li>
                <li>800g / 28 oz canned crushed tomato</li>
                <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 cup pinot noir red wine , or other dry red wine </li>
                <li>3 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves , dried or fresh</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp EACH dried thyme and oregano</li>
                <li>2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                <li>1 – 2 tsp sugar </li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt and black pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
                <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
                <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
                <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required.</li>
            </ol>
